# DSS Algorithm based on ElGamal Scheme

<h2> Purpose: </h2>

<p>
  This is an assignment made in my ECE 458 elective that implements a Digital Signature Standard (DSS) algorithm based on ElGamal Scheme, which can be used to generate and verify digital signatures with a private and public key pair. This DSS algorithm utilizes the SHA-224 cryptographic hash function and is extremely useful in the context of verifying the integrity of digital signatures such as in the field of Blockchain applications.
